Pacman with JavaScript
This is a fun project I created to build a Pacman game using JavaScript. The game can be played using either the arrow keys or AWDS.

How to play
To play the game, simply use the arrow keys or AWDS to move Pacman around the screen and eat all the dots without getting caught by the ghosts. The game ends when all the dots have been eaten or Pacman is caught by a ghost.

Technologies used

Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the classic Pacman game and was created as a fun learning exercise.
